## About The Project

Empress Python Wrapper for ngrok allows you to leverage ngrok's capabilities via a user-friendly Python API. It's an excellent tool for developers who want to create secure, reliable connections between public URLs and their local servers.

### Key Features

- Open HTTP and SSH tunnels
- Manage your ngrok binary
- Create secure connections from localhost to public URLs

### Built With
This project is built using Python. It supports all Python versions above 2.7. For Python 2.7 usage, ensure to pin `pyngrok>=4.1,<4.2`.

## Getting Started
Install Empress Python Wrapper for ngrok using pip or conda. 

To clone the repo, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/python_wrapper_ngrok.git
```
Then, install the project using pip:

```sh
pip install pyngrok
```
or with conda:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge pyngrok
```
After installation, ngrok is available from the command line.

### Usage

You can open a tunnel using the `connect` method. This method returns a `NgrokTunnel` object, which includes a reference to the public URL generated by `ngrok` in its `public_url` attribute. Here's a quick start guide:

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok

http_tunnel = ngrok.connect() # Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80
ssh_tunnel = ngrok.connect(22, "tcp") # Open a SSH tunnel
```
